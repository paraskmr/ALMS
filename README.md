# 🧠 Automated Log Monitoring System (ALMS)

A Linux-based automation system built using modular shell scripts that scans log files for critical patterns and simulates alerts. Designed with software engineering principles including abstraction, encapsulation, modularity, cohesion, and low coupling. Fully compatible with **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following packages are installed on your WSL instance:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git bash grep bats
🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Project
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ALMS.git
cd ALMS
Or manually download and extract the ZIP file.

2. Make Scripts Executable
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x run.sh scripts/*.sh
3. Run the System
bash
Copy
Edit
./run.sh
Expected output:

lua

[INFO] 2025-04-18 10:30:00 - Starting WSL Log Monitoring on /home/user/ALMS/logs/sample_syslog.log...
[INFO] ... Alert triggered: Apr 18 ... error loading module
[ALERT EMAIL] Apr 18 ... error loading module
🧪 Unit Testing
Install BATS if not already available:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install bats
Run tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd test
bats test_monitor_logs.bats
🕒 Crontab Automation (Optional)
To automate execution every 10 minutes:

bash
Copy
Edit
crontab -e
Add the following line (update path as per your user):

bash
Copy
Edit
*/10 * * * * /home/<your-username>/ALMS/run.sh >> /home/<your-username>/ALMS/logs/cron_output.log 2>&1
📊 Performance Tools
Monitor performance using:

bash
Copy
Edit
time ./run.sh        # Measure execution time
top                  # Monitor CPU/Memory
vmstat               # System stats
iostat               # Disk I/O
📃 Design Principles Used

Principle	Application
Abstraction	Defined monitor_logs, send_email_alert functions
Encapsulation	Separate scripts for tasks: monitoring, alerts, utilities
Modularity	Each file has one clear responsibility
High Cohesion	Functions are focused and related
Low Coupling	Scripts interact through well-defined interfaces only
🛠️ Git & Version Control
Initialize repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git tag v1.0
Branching workflow:
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b feature/alert-enhancement
# Make changes
git commit -am "Updated alert format"
git checkout main
git merge feature/alert-enhancement
Track versions in changelog.md.

🧰 Sample Log File
Located in logs/sample_syslog.log, contains entries like:

less
Copy
Edit
Apr 18 12:00:01 localhost CRON[12345]: something failed
Apr 18 12:00:02 localhost systemd[1]: error loading module
Apr 18 12:00:03 localhost kernel: critical memory leak
❗ Troubleshooting

Issue	Solution
Script not executing	Use chmod +x on shell files
Log file not found	Check file path and existence
Cron not working	Use full paths, check cron.log
No alert shown	Ensure log file contains keywords

A modular and automated log monitoring system for Linux environments (tested in **WSL**) using Bash scripting. It scans log files for critical keywords and simulates sending alerts while applying key software design principles: **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, **modularity**, **high cohesion**, and **low coupling**.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed in your **WSL (Ubuntu)**:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git bash grep bats
🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ALMS.git
cd ALMS
2. Make Scripts Executable
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x run.sh scripts/*.sh
3. Run the Monitoring System
bash

Edit
[INFO] Starting WSL Log Monitoring on /home/user/ALMS/logs/sample_syslog.log...
[ALERT EMAIL] Apr 18 ... error loading module
🧪 Unit Testing
Install and use bats for testing:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd test
bats test_monitor_logs.bats
🕒 Cron Job Automation (Optional)
To run the system every 10 minutes:

bash
Copy
Edit
crontab -e

bash
Copy
Edit
*/10 * * * * /home/<your-username>/ALMS/run.sh >> /home/<your-username>/ALMS/logs/cron_output.log 2>&1
🧠 Design Principles Used

Principle	Implementation
Abstraction	Defined key operations like log monitoring and alerting as high-level functions
Encapsulation	Grouped logic into dedicated script files
Modularity	Each script performs a specific task
High Cohesion	Functions perform closely related actions
Low Coupling	Scripts interact only via defined interfaces
📊 Performance Testing
You can evaluate performance using:

bash
Copy
Edit
time ./run.sh         # Execution time
top                   # CPU/memory
vmstat                # Virtual memory stats
iostat                # Disk I/O usage
🧰 Sample Log File
Located in logs/sample_syslog.log, containing entries like:

lua
Copy
Edit
Apr 18 12:00:02 localhost systemd[1]: error loading module
Apr 18 12:00:03 localhost kernel: critical memory leak
🛠️ Git & Version Control Strategy
Initialize repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git tag v1.0
Use branches
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b feature/improve-logging
# Make changes, commit
git checkout main
git merge feature/improve-logging
Track versioning in changelog.md.

❗ Troubleshooting

Issue	Solution
Permission Denied	Run chmod +x on the script
No output/alert	Check contents of sample_syslog.log
Cron not working	Use absolute paths, check /var/log/syslog
BATS not installed	Run sudo apt install bats
